This code was made by Jet Le for the Semester 1 2024 Sudoku Solution Validator (SSV) Assignment

Requirements:
Ensure that the following is within the directory...
    - 'child.c', 'child.h'
    - 'mssv.c', 'mssv.h'
    - 'testdata.txt'
    - 'makefile'
    - And this 'readme' file

Compiling the code:
    - Use 'make' to compile the code
    - Use 'make clean' to clean the compiled code

Running the code:
    - Run with './mssv <testdata.txt> <delay number>'
    - Where <testdata.txt> is the sodoku solution file, in this case it is 'testdata.txt'
    - Where delay number is an integer between 1-10
    - For example: './mssv testdata.txt 1'
